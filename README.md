This is an android application that allows users to enjoy practising yoga and meditation with anybody, anywhere by providing users with different virtual environments.

## <a name="second"></a>Motivation
Meditation is an enormously wealthy gift to humanity. The benefits of meditation are now not hidden from anyone. Have you ever wondered why people still don't pratice yoga and meditation ? Research shows that the main reasons behind ignorance towards meditation/ yoga are
